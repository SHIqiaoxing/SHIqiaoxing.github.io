This is my first year in computer science and technology. To be honest, I haven't been to Australia and have been taking online classes.</p>
                                        <p>I am very interested in learning with students from different cultural backgrounds!
I like traveling very much. I have been to more than 80 cities in China. I like to experience different customs. I also look forward to traveling to different countries overseas in the coming days. Besides traveling, I like playing music very much. I can play piano and saxophone. Music allows me to relax and make a lot of friends who have the same music hobby.</p>

                                        <p>Because I have some leadership, although creativity is not strong, but can play a better role in team leadership, to find creative teammates, so that we can learn from each other to build a perfect team.</p>

                                        <p>Compared with our impression of full screen character programming, low code development is a way of program development without code or using less code. We can compare the use of low code development to LEGO. Each functional module is like a small building block. If we put them together in different ways, we can get different finished products.</p>

                                        <h2>Motivation</h2>
                                        <p>Generally speaking, in the process of developing a program, a considerable part of the work of programmers is repetitive and cumbersome. According to the data of frevvo, low code development can increase the speed of digital transformation by 69%, which can not only reduce the dependence on high-tech level, but also shorten the development time of applications, Programmers can be liberated from this part of the work, and more people can participate in application development. Not only programmers with professional programming ability, but also business personnel with non-technical background can build applications. For large enterprises, low code development platform can also reduce the initial cost of it team training and technology deployment.</p>

                                        <h2>Description</h2>
                                        <p>Fast start: due to the characteristics of low code, it will undoubtedly greatly reduce the difficulty of learning programming language, especially the 0 code development platform, and even business personnel who do not understand programming language can quickly learn and develop applications.</p>
                                        <p>Fast development: due to the use of a large number of components and encapsulated interfaces for development, as well as the IAAs and PAAS layer capabilities of integrated cloud computing, the development efficiency is greatly improved; the general view is that low code can improve the development efficiency by more than 30%, while 0 code (no code) can improve the development efficiency several times; and greatly reduce the development cost.</p>
                                        <p>Fast running: This is a relative concept. Generally speaking, due to the low code development platform using automatic compilation into executable code, the overall quality of the code is better than the average level of the industry; and relatively speaking, bugs are more controllable, and the security of the code will be higher.</p>
                                        <p>Fast operation and maintenance: in general, low code development platform adopts component form and object-oriented development mode, which makes the code more structured and easier to maintain.</p>
                                        <p>Low code refers to a development method, more specifically, a development platform, which is called "low code development platform". Specifically, it refers to a development platform that can quickly generate applications without coding or through a small amount of code. It is a method of application development through visualization, so that developers with different levels of experience can go through the graphical user interface Using drag and drop components and model driven logic to create web pages and mobile applications.</p>

                                        <p>If the project is successful, on the one hand, it can reduce the human cost of enterprise application development; on the other hand, in the Internet era of rapid progress in technology and application, it can double the original development time of several months or even years, so as to help enterprises effectively realize the value of cost reduction, efficiency increase and flexible iteration.</p>
                                        <p>It completely subverts the development mode of the existing software enterprises, makes them more efficient, greatly reduces the repetitive labor in the coding process, liberates the programmers from the heavy and business development process, and invests in the more critical core code development, so as to make the code output more valuable.</p>
                                        <p>The emergence of low code development platform will further promote the status of programmers, stripping the so-called "blue collar" programmers from the real programmer team, and the requirements for them are not what some programmer training schools can achieve through training, so that programmers can really stand at a higher level and older programmers become more valuable.</p>
